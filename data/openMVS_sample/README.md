# openMVS_sample

A complete OpenMVS library usage example is presented here with all necessary files (including Windows x64 binaries) and the obtained output. For this we used the [Sceaux Castle](https://github.com/openMVG/ImageDataset_SceauxCastle) images and [OpenMVG](https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG) pipeline to recover camera positions and the sparse point-cloud. Please note that all output contained here is the original output obtained automatically by the OpenMVS pipeline, with no manual manipulation of the results.
